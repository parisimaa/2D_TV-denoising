# 2D_TV-denoising
Total variation (TV) regularization is a method for solving linear inverse problems, which involves the recovery of a signal or image from incomplete or noisy measurements. In particular, TV regularization is often used in cases where the signal or image has sharp edges or discontinuities, as it promotes sparsity in the gradient of the signal or image. <br>
